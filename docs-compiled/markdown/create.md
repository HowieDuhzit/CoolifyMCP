# Creating Destinations

This guide shows you how to create new destinations in Coolify for deploying your applications and databases.

## Prerequisites

Before creating a destination, ensure you have:

- At least one server connected to Coolify
- Appropriate permissions to manage destinations
- Basic understanding of [Docker networks](https://docs.docker.com/engine/network/)

## Creating a New Destination

### Method 1: From Destinations Page

<ZoomableImage src="/docs/images/destinations/create-destination.webp" />

1. Navigate to **Destinations** in the main navigation
2. Click on **+ Add**
3. Fill in the destination details.

### Method 2: From Server Management

<ZoomableImage src="/docs/images/destinations/server-create-destination.webp" />

1. Go to **Servers** and select your server
2. Navigate to the **Destinations** tab
3. Click **+ Add**
4. Fill in the destination details.

## Configuration Options

<ZoomableImage src="/docs/images/destinations/create-destination-modal.webp" />

### Destination Name

- Auto-generated based on server name and network ID
- Can be customized to be more descriptive

### Network Name

- Must be unique per server
- Auto-generated unique identifier (CUID2 format)
- Can be customized to be more descriptive
- Cannot be changed after creation
- Used as the actual Docker network name

### Server Selection

- Choose from available servers in your team
- Server must be online and accessible
- Can not be a [build server](/builds/servers)
- Determines where the Docker network will be created

### Destination Type

The destination type is **automatically determined** based on your selected server's configuration:

#### Standalone Docker

- **Automatically selected** when the server is configured as a standalone Docker host
- Creates a standard Docker network
- Suitable for single-server deployments
- Supports bridge and custom networks

#### Docker Swarm

- **Automatically selected** when the server is configured as a Docker Swarm manager or worker
- Creates overlay networks for multi-node communication
- Server must have Docker Swarm mode enabled during server setup
- Advanced feature for clustered deployments

::: tip Server Configuration Determines Type
You cannot manually choose between Standalone Docker and Docker Swarm when creating a destination. The type is determined by how your server was configured when it was added to Coolify.

## Automatic Network Creation

When you create a destination, Coolify automatically:

1. **Creates the Docker network** on the target server
2. **Connects the proxy** (Traefik/Caddy) to the network
3. **Configures network settings** for proper isolation
4. **Enables inter-container communication** within the network

## Network Scanning

You can also scan existing Docker networks on a server and add them as destinations:

<ZoomableImage src="/docs/images/destinations/scan-networks.webp" />

1. Go to **Server** and select your server
2. Navigate to **Destinations**
3. Click **Scan for Destinations**
4. Select existing networks to import and Coolify will create destination entries for them

## Validation and Errors

Common errors when creating destinations:

- **Network already added to this server**: The network name conflicts with an existing one

## After Creation

Once created, your destination will:

- Appear in the destinations list
- Be available for deploying applications and databases
- Have network connectivity configured automatically
- Be ready to host your containerized resources
