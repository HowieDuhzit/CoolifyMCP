<br />

If you're using [Coolify Cloud ↗](https://coolify.io/pricing/), the Coolify team handles all updates so you don’t need to worry about them. 

For those who **self-host** Coolify, there are three ways to upgrade your instance:

- [Automatic Upgrade:](#_1-automatic-upgrade) For users who want easy, hands-off updates.
- [Semi-Automatic Upgrade:](#_2-semi-automatic-upgrade) For users who want control over when to apply updates.
- [Manual Upgrade:](#_3-manual-upgrade) For advanced users who prefer to manage the upgrade process themselves.

:::danger **Backup First!**  
  > **Always back up your Coolify data before starting an upgrade.**
:::


## 1. Automatic Upgrade
Coolify can update itself automatically. This option keeps your instance always up-to-date without any extra effort.

### How it works?
Coolify periodically checks the [CDN ↗](https://cdn.coollabs.io/coolify/versions.json) for updates. When a new version is available, it automatically fetches the latest release from the [official repository ↗](https://github.com/orgs/coollabsio/packages?repo_name=coolify) and starts the upgrade process on its own.

### Customize Automatic Updates  
If you’d rather manage updates yourself, you can disable auto-updates in your Coolify dashboard’s Settings.

::: info Tip
Turning off automatic updates lets you test a new version on a staging setup before updating your live environment.

## 2. Semi-Automatic Upgrade
This option gives you a bit more control. Coolify notifies you when an update is available, and you decide when to apply it.

### How it works?
Coolify periodically checks the [CDN ↗](https://cdn.coollabs.io/coolify/versions.json) for updates. When a new version is available, you will see an "**Upgrade**" button in the sidebar of your Coolify dashboard.

Click the upgrade button to start the update process.

### Set Update Frequency
You can also choose how often Coolify checks for updates by adjusting the settings (daily, weekly, etc.).

::: info Tip:
This method is perfect if you want to review update details or test the upgrade before applying it.
:::


## 3. Manual Upgrade
For those who prefer full control, you can upgrade Coolify manually.

### How to do this?
Open your server's terminal and run the command below:

```sh
curl -fsSL https://cdn.coollabs.io/coolify/install.sh | bash
```

To upgrade to a specific version, run the following command in your terminal:
```sh
curl -fsSL https://cdn.coollabs.io/coolify/install.sh | bash -s 4.0.0-beta.400
```
Replace `4.0.0-beta.400` with the version number you want to upgrade to. 


### How it works?
This command runs the official [Coolify installation script ↗](https://github.com/coollabsio/coolify/blob/main/scripts/install.sh). The script checks the [CDN ↗](https://cdn.coollabs.io/coolify/versions.json) for the latest version and updates your Coolify Instance.


::: success Tip
In the Automatic and Semi-Automatic methods, Coolify runs the installation script automatically in the background. 

In the Manual upgrade method, you run the script yourself.
