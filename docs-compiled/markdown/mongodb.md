## What is MongoDB

MongoDB is a popular, open-source document-oriented NoSQL database designed for scalability and flexibility. It stores data in flexible, JSON-like documents, meaning fields can vary from document to document and data structure can be changed over time.

MongoDB is known for its horizontal scalability, powerful query language, and ability to handle large volumes of unstructured or semi-structured data. It's widely used in modern web applications, content management systems, and other scenarios where flexible data models and scalability are crucial.
