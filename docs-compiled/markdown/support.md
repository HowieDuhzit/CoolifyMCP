## Community Support  
Join our [Discord community ↗](https://coollabs.io/discord) with over **13K members**, where you can create a post in the **support forum channel** for assistance. 

While the community does provide some help, the [Core team ↗](/get-started/team) is actively involved in the forum to ensure questions are addressed.  

## Direct Support from Core Developers
If you are a **Coolify Cloud user**, you can reach out via email at **hi@coollabs.io** for direct support from [Andras (Coolify’s founder)](https://x.com/heyandras). Since he personally handles emails, response times may be delayed. 

We highly recommend posting in the **Discord support forum** first, as core team members can escalate issues to the developers ([Andras](https://x.com/heyandras) & [Peak](https://x.com/peaklabs_dev)) if necessary.  

## Important Notes  
- We are a **small team** (fewer than **6 people**) supporting **140K+ users**, making it challenging to offer direct assistance to everyone. However, we do our best to help as much as possible.  
- We are planning a **paid support option** for **self-hosted users**. If you need dedicated support for your **self-hosted instance**, email **hi@coollabs.io** to discuss options.
