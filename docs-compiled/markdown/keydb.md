## What is KeyDB

KeyDB is a high-performance fork of Redis, focusing on multithreading, memory efficiency, and high availability. It maintains API compatibility with Redis while offering improved performance, especially on multi-core systems. KeyDB introduces features like active replication, FLASH storage support, and subkey expires to enhance the capabilities of the traditional Redis model.

Designed to be a drop-in replacement for Redis, KeyDB aims to provide better resource utilization and scalability for applications requiring high-throughput in-memory data storage and processing.
